            <h1> Hi! My name is Joseph, <br> I am going to tell you about my hobby which is coding. </h1> 
        <div class="line"> </div>
        <p> I like coding. I love coding because I find it cool and interesting. I also like it because it really teaches you a lot. I love coding because I can do so much with it and it truly makes me happy! I love coding because I could make a lot of money with it and invent things. With those inventions and that money I can help people! I'll give you an example: donating to good causes and charity! I have admired coding for a very long time. </p>

In reality, Gates and Allen did not have an Altair and had not written code for it; they merely wanted to gauge MITS's interest. MITS president Ed Roberts agreed to meet them for a demonstration, and over the course of a few weeks they developed an Altair emulator that ran on a minicomputer, and then the BASIC interpreter. The demonstration was held at MITS's offices in Albuquerque, New Mexico; it was a success and resulted in a deal with MITS to distribute the interpreter as Altair BASIC. MITS hired Allen, and Gates took a leave of absence from Harvard to work with him at MITS in November 1975. Allen named their partnership "Micro-Soft", a combination of "microcomputer" and "software", and their first office was in Albuquerque. The first employee Gates and Allen hired was their high school collaborator Ric Weiland. They dropped the hyphen within a year and officially registered the trade name "Microsoft" with the Secretary of the State of New Mexico on November 26, 1976. Bill Gates never returned to Harvard to complete his studies.</h2> </h1>
